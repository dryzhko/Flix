A work in progress
A cross-platform hybrid Movie App i'm working on using the Ionic Framework with AngularJS.

Finished Product will have functionality to display newly released movies on homepage, 
have a search page to look up information on movies, and have a watchlist where you can 
add movies you want to watch.

Uses TheMovieDataBase API to get information regarding movies
